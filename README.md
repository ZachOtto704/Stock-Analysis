Stock Analysis for Green Energy Stocks

Overview of Project:
The purpose of this project was to help our client, Steve, analyze multiple green energy stocks. We used a data file that held trading information for 12 different stocks, with data from each trading day of the year for each stock. We sorted through all this data by giving Steve the total yearly return for each individual stock, and the total volume for the year for each individual stock. We did this by creating macros that sorted through the data and returned the information we wanted on our output sheet. After creating a macro script to run our test, we also created a refactored code that ran the same test even more efficiently. 

Results:
Although, both macros returned the same data, the refactored code ran much more efficiently. Looking at the run times below, we can see the difference.

Here, we can see that the refactored code ran
